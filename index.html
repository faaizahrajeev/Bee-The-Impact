<p>A vast majority of flowering plants- fruits and vegetables, nuts, coffee, and even spices rely on pollinators like bees to reproduce. Nearly 90% of flowering plant species on the planet require pollinators to aid in reproduction.</p>
<p>Natural pollinators such as wild bees -solitary bees and bumblebees, and hoverflies are responsible for the majority of pollination services. A British study has shown that the UK honeybee population only provides at most one third of pollination services, with the remainder being supplied by wild pollinators. </p>
<p>Flowers that are difficult for honeybees to work, such as red clover, alfalfa or tomato, are pollinated by specialized wild bee species. Wild bees generally are very effective pollinators: Only a few hundred females of the mason bee Osmia cornuta are needed to pollinate a hectare of apple or almond trees, whereas tens of thousands of honeybee workers would be needed. Similarly, wild bees have proved to be superior to honeybees in polinating cherry trees and rapeseed plants in pollination trials.</p>

    <p>Bees lie at the heart of our survival. They pollinate 1 in 3 bites of food we eat and are essential to the health and prosperity of countless ecosystems. But today, bee colonies are in trouble. Bees are in decline on a global scale as they face many threats, from habitat loss to the use of toxic pesticides. Many of the threats to bees share parallels with the threats to trees and woodland, so saving bees goes hand-in-hand with saving trees.</p></div>

<div class="preconditions">
  <p class="thecooltext">THEIR DEMANDS</p>
  <p>To understand the threats to Wild Bees, let’s understand their demands in terms of food and nesting resources. Abundance significantly affects reproductive success as the wild bees' quantitative pollen requirements for feeding their larvae are very high. Therefore the provision of a succession of floral resources from early spring to late Summer (during their periods of flight activity) is essential to maintaining species diversity in a given landscape.</p></div>
<div class="preconditionSub1">
<div class="leftText">
  <p>Another precondition of wild bee diversity at landscape level is the provision of small-scale habitat features exposed to the sun; these are needed for nest establishment. For example, the most important nesting sites of central European wild bees include bare or sparsely vegetated soil, coarse woody debris, rock and stone features as well as uncut vegetation containing plant stems and empty snail shells. </p></div>
<div class="rightImage"><br>
  <img src="assets/snailShellBee.jpg" width="370" height="240"><br>
</div></div>
    <br>
<div class="preconditions"><br>
<p>As wild bees must fly back and forth a lot between food plants and nesting sites in order to provision their brood cells, the spatial distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants is critical to their reproductive success. </p>
<p>Given these high demands in terms of food and nesting resources, wild bees are very sensitive to any changes in landscapes and habitats which reduce or spatially alter the provision of floral resources and small-scale habitat features.</p></div>

<br><br>
<div class="threats">
  <div class="rightText">
  <p class="thecooltext">SO WHY ARE THEY DECLINING?</p>
  <p>Landscapes and land uses have changed dramatically since the 1960s. Many nutrient-poor, extensively farmed habitats rich in flowers and small-scale features were destroyed in the course of farmers adopting intensified or industrial-style farming practices. At the same time, valuable marginal lands were left fallow or were re-colonized by woodland as a result of land abandonment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="leftImage">
    
    <img src="assets/beeDead.jpg" width="370" height="253"></div>

</div>

    <br class="containerdivNewLine"><br><br>
<div class="reasons"><br>
  
<p><strong>1. Destruction or damaging of suitable habitats:</strong> An increase in urban developments and invasive farming methods has meant that many of the areas bees once called home no longer exist. The decline in diversity and abundance of flowering plants, loss of sun-exposed small-scale habitats, and fragmentation of habitats rich in wildflowers adversely affect bees.</p>
 <br> </div>

    <div class="leftText">
<p ><strong>2. Agricultural Inputs:</strong> One of the main threats to our beloved bees is the use of toxic pesticides. Whilst pesticides are designed to kill pests, due to their intense toxicity they are having an adverse effect on other insects. Wild bees, honeybees, hoverflies, beetles, and many other flower visitors are thus exposed to these substances. Neonicotinoids, for example, impact negatively on the behaviour, reproduction and brain development of honeybees, bumblebees, solitary and stingless bees.</p></div>

    <br><br>
  <img id="insecti" src="assets/insecticide.jpg" width="370" height="253">
<br><br><br><br>
<div class="reasons"><br>
<p><strong>3. Natural Factors:</strong> Parasites and fungal infection of food stores are among the natural factors that have a harmful effect on bees. Climate change and the extreme weather it often causes is another contributing factor in the decline of bees. It disrupts bee nesting behaviour and alters the normal seasonal timings, meaning flowers may bloom earlier or later than expected.
