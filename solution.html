<p class="thecooltext">WHAT CAN I DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL?</p>
</div>
<div class="leftText">
  <p><strong>1. Plant a Bee Garden-</strong></p><p> Bees need shelter to nest and hibernate in. You can create your own shelter or buy a ready-made bee hotel – just hang it up in a sunny sheltered spot in your garden and watch bees filling the tubes during the spring and summer months.</p>

  <br>
  <p><strong>2. Fill your garden with bee-friendly flowers-</strong></p><p> One of the easiest ways to help out bees is by planting lots of bee-friendly flowers in your garden. Bees favour a wide range of flowering plants, including foxglove, birdsfoot trefoil and red clover.</p>

<div class="rightText">
<p><strong>3. Go Chemical-Free for Bees-</strong></p><p> Synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, and neonicotinoids are harmful to bees, wreaking havoc on their sensitive systems. Avoid treating your garden and green spaces with synthetics. Instead, use organic products and natural solutions such compost to aid soil health and adding beneficial insects that keep pests away like ladybugs and praying mantises.</p>
</div>


<br><br class="containerdivNewLine">
<div class="leftText">
<p><strong>4. Help a bee in need-</strong></p><p>Often during the summer months you may spot a solitary bee sitting unmoving on the ground. Whilst it is easy to presume it might be dead or dying, chances are it is actually exhausted and in need of a quick pick-me-up. You can help out a tired bee by mixing two tablespoons of white, granulated sugar with one tablespoon of water, placing it near the bee so it can help itself to this homemade energy drink.</p>

  <br>
  <p><strong>5. Create a Bee Bath-</strong></p><p>Bees work up quite a thirst foraging and collecting nectar. Fill a shallow bird bath or bowl with clean water, and arrange pebbles and stones inside so that they break the water’s surface. Bees will land on the stones and pebbles to take a long, refreshing drink.</p>

<p class="thecooltext">STEPS TO BE TAKEN BY THE FARMING SECTOR</p>
  <p><strong>1. Maintenance of habitats rich in floral resources and small-scale features</strong></p>
  <p>Any measures designed to increase the abundance, diversity, and distribution of flowering plants and small-scale habitat features well exposed to the sun will foster greater species diversity and increase population sizes in wild bees. It is critical in this context that food and nesting resources are located in close proximity and that there is continuous provision of floral resources from early spring to late summer. Ultimately the pollination of crop plants and wild plants by wild insects is the basis of sustainable food security and substantially contributes to the maintenance of biodiversity as the foundation on which life is built as well as to safeguarding many key ecosystem services.</p><br>

<div class="farmingSector"><br>
<p><strong>2. Adopt Organic Management</strong></p><p>Organic farming can promote wild bee diversity and abundance not only at the individual farm level but also at the landscape level. Several studies have shown that organic farming positively impacts on wild bee species diversity, abundance and reproduction rates. Especially in relatively homogenous landscapes, organic farms enhance  reproduction (nesting sites) in solitary bees (such as Osmia lignaria). On organic farms, wild bees can ensure higher crop pollination success, especially in demanding crops such as watermelons, making the farms less dependent on the more expensive pollinators such as bumblebees and honeybees.</p><br>

  <p>This is due in part to the following practices: </p><p>1. No applications of chemical-synthetic pesticides.</p><p>2. No applications of chemical fertilizers.</p><p>3. More frequent inclusion of grass-clover leys in arable crop rotations. Legumes such as alfalfa, red dover and white clover support a range of bumblebee and other wild bee species, offering them ample food.</p><p>4. Non-chemical weed control measures. These result in a flower-rich arable flora including important sources of pollen and nectar.</p><p>5. Extensive grassland management results in more flower-rich, less grass-dominated swards and ultimately in more insect-pollinated plants.</p>

<p class="thecooltext">STEPS TO BE TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT</p>
  <p><strong>1. Ban the seven most dangerous pesticides-</strong></p>
  <p>As explained in the problem page, pesticides- especially Neonicotinoids, are one of the main threats to wild bees. Major retailers such as Lowe’s, The Home Depot, Walmart, Ace Hardware and many others have made commitments to move the market away from selling bee-killing neonicotinoids. However, Amazon and small retailers continue to sell these pesticides to farmers. </p><br>
</div>
    <br>

<div class="rightText">
  <p><strong>2. Protect pollinator health by preserving wild habitat- </strong></p><p>Parks, wildlife refuges, national parks and more should be free of bee-killing pesticides. Wildflowers should be preserved as they provide lots of the essentials that bees need to thrive; food in the form of nectar and pollen, as well places to shelter and rest.Any measures designed to increase the abundance, diversity and distribution of flowering plants and small-scale habitat features well exposed to the sun will foster greater species diversity and increase population sizes in wild bees.</p></div>

<p><strong>3. Restore Ecological Agriculture-</strong></p><p>Ecological farming is the overarching new policy trend that will stabilize human food production, preserve wild habitats, and protect the bees. The nation of Bhutan has led the world in adopting a 100 percent organic farming policy. Mexico has banned genetically modified corn to protect its native corn varieties. Eight European countries have banned genetically modified crops and Hungary has burned more than 1,000 acres of corn contaminated with genetically modified varieties.</p>

  <p>Ecological farming resists insect damage by avoiding large monocrops and preserving ecosystem diversity. Ecological farming restores soil nutrients with natural composting systems, avoids soil loss from wind and water erosion, and avoids pesticides and chemical fertilizers. By restoring bee populations and healthier bees, ecological agriculture improves pollination, which in turn improves crop yields. Ecological farming takes advantage of the natural ecosystem services, water filtration, pollination, oxygen production, and disease and pest control. Organic farmers have advocated better research and funding by industry, government, farmers, and the public to develop organic farming techniques, improve food production, and maintain ecological health.
